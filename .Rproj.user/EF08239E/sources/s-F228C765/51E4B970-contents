df_syndrome <- read_csv("syndrome.csv")

###First let's see how a univariate model works
lmer_b <- lmer(boldness ~ scale(assay_rep, scale=FALSE) + scale(body_size) + (1|ID), data = df_syndrome)

plot(lmer_b)
qqnorm(residuals(lmer_b)) #what does this tell us?
hist(residuals(lmer_b))

summary(lmer_b) #we're interested in the random effects section of the summary specifically the variance component

##compute repeatability (personality) by dividing the variance in the trait due to difference among individuals (Vid) by the total phenotypic variance adter account for the fixed effects (Vid + Vresiduals)

#use broom to do this automatically
rep_bold <- tidy(lmer_b, effects = "ran_pars", scales = "vcov") %>%
  select(group, estimate) %>%
  spread(group, estimate) %>%
  mutate(repeatability = ID/(ID + Residual))
rep_bold

##do the same for exploration
lmer_e <- lmer(exploration ~ scale(assay_rep, scale = FALSE) + scale(body_size) + (1|ID), data = df_syndrome)

#calculate repeatability
rep_expl <- tidy(lmer_e, effects = "ran_pars", scales = "vcov") %>%
  select(group, estimate) %>%
  spread(group, estimate) %>%
  mutate(repeatbility = ID/(ID+Residual))
rep_expl

##Correlations using BLUPS

#create two data frames of individual predictions extracted from model fits (for boldness and exploration) then join them
df_BLUPS_B <- tibble(ID = row.names(ranef(lmer_b)$ID),
                         BLUP_B = ranef(lmer_b)$ID[,"(Intercept)"])
df_BLUPS_E <- tibble(ID = row.names(ranef(lmer_e)$ID),
                         BLUP_E = ranef(lmer_e)$ID[,"(Intercept)"])
df_BLUPS_EB <- left_join(df_BLUPS_E, df_BLUPS_B,
                         by = "ID")

#plot
plot(df_BLUPS_EB$BLUP_B ~ df_BLUPS_EB$BLUP_E)

#perform a correlation test of these traits 
cor.test(df_BLUPS_EB$BLUP_E, df_BLUPS_EB$BLUP_B)

##Using BLUPs this way leads to anticonservative significance tests because the rror inherent in their prediction is not carried forward from the lmer models to the subsequent analysis
